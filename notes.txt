Redux Overview
Actions go through dispatcher which changes store which changes store
all changes go through dispatcher
Main Principles
Single Source of truth
-single state object tree within a single store
State is read only (no getters no setters)
-Changes should only be done through Actions
Changes are made through pure functions aka reducers
-take previos state and action and return next state
-no mutatino of previous state, create whole new state
Reducer recieves actions from dispatch
reducer functions result in new state
state changes reflected to views
uni directional data flow

Redux Thunk
middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action
-can be used to delay the dispatch of an action
-can be used to dispatch only if certain conditions met
Inner function receives the dispatch() and getState() store methods

Fetch
xmlhttprequest is outdated
fetch api is modern replacement for requests
provides interface for fetching resources
powerful, flexible, promise based
